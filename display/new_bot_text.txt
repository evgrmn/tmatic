Since Timatic is an automated trading tool, you first need to set up a strategy.

You can create as many strategies (bots) as you want. Each bot has its own strategy.py file, and they are all stored in separate folders in the /algo folder. So the path to strategy.py might look like algo/mybot/strategy.py.

Timatic keeps all transactions you make since the beginning of your trading activity. These transactions include: trades, funding and delivery of expired instruments. So you can monitor open positions, PNLs, fundings and fees received or paid by you. Financial results are separated by currencies and can be viewed for each strategy alone or for the whole market connected to Timatic.

Bot management includes:

<New Bot> creates a bot with a new unique name.
<Syntax> checks whether the bot's algo code syntax is correct.
<Backtest> allows to backtest the bot's trading algorithm (under development).
<State> activates or suspends trading according to bot's algorithm.
<Parameters> changes the parameters associated with the bot.
<Merge> unites two bots into one. Bot being deleted must have no active orders.
<Duplicate> replicates selected bot, creating a new one with the same parameters.
<Delete> this operation completely removes the selected bot.
